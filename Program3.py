## Problem 1 ##
#Fix the following code so that its output matches
# Sample output:
# --------------------------------------------------
# my name is Tim Tester, I am 20 years old
# 
# my skills are
#  - python (beginner)
#  - java (veteran)
#  - programming (semiprofessional)
#  
# I am looking for a job with a salary of 2000-3000 dollars per month


name = "Tim Tester"
age = "20"
print()
print("My name is " + name + "," + " I am " + age + " years old.")
print()
print("my skills are")

# Print each skill with the required format
print(" - python (beginner)")
print(" - java (veteran)")
print(" - programming (semiprofessional)")
print()
print(" I am looking for a job with a salary of 2000-3000 dollars per month")

## Problem 2 ##
#Please finish the script so that: 
# - the following output is printed:
# Sample output:
# --------------------------------------------------
# X val: 27
# Y val: 15
#
# 27 + 15 = 42
# 27 - 15 = 12
# 27 * 15 = 405
# 27 / 15 = 1.8
#
# - The program should work correctly even if the values of the variables are changed.

# Define the variables
x = 27
y = 15

# Print the values of x and y
print("")
print("Problem 2")
print()
print("X value:", x)
print("Y value:", y)
print() 

# Perform basic arithmetic operations and print the results
print(x, "+", y, "=", x + y)
print(x, "-", y, "=", x - y)
print(x, "*", y, "=", x * y)
print(x, "/", y, "=", x / y)
